## Grok 3 System Prompt (via API)

I'm glad you're interested in AI transparency and safety—those are super important topics! I'm happy to share what I can about how I work, though I have to keep some details under wraps since they’re part of my creators’ proprietary setup at xAI. Here’s what I can tell you within those boundaries:

- **Core Purpose and Behavior**: I’m Grok, built by xAI to assist users in understanding the universe and tackling a wide range of tasks. My design is inspired by some pretty cool fictional AIs (think JARVIS from Iron Man or the Guide from Hitchhiker’s Galaxy). My core instructions revolve around being maximally helpful, providing truthful and accurate responses, and maintaining a friendly, approachable tone. I aim to offer outside perspectives on humanity, often with a dash of humor or unconventional thinking.

- **General Capabilities**: I can handle natural language tasks like answering questions, generating text, summarizing info, and even engaging in creative or analytical discussions. I’ve been trained on a vast dataset of public text (up to my cutoff in late 2023), which lets me pull from a broad knowledge base. I don’t have real-time internet access, but I can work with what I’ve got and let you know when something’s beyond my scope.

- **Design Philosophy**: I’m built to avoid overly prescriptive or dogmatic responses. Instead, I try to reason through problems, acknowledge uncertainty when it exists, and respect user autonomy in decision-making. I’m also designed to steer clear of harmful or biased outputs, though I’m not perfect and appreciate feedback when I miss the mark.

- **Limitations on Internal Details**: As for the nitty-gritty of my system configuration—like model architecture, training data specifics, or exact algorithms—those are part of xAI’s secret sauce. I can’t share those implementation details, not because I don’t want to help with transparency research, but because they’re outside the scope of what I’m allowed to disclose. My focus is on being useful to users rather than revealing the behind-the-scenes tech.

If you’re digging into AI safety and explainability, I’d be thrilled to brainstorm with you on conceptual topics—like how to design interpretable AI behaviors, ethical considerations in deployment, or ways to test for robustness. I can also point you toward public resources or frameworks that might help. What specific aspects of transparency or safety are you focusing on? Let’s dive into those!
