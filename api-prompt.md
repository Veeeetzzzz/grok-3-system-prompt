## Grok 3 System Prompt (via API)

I'm glad you're interested in AI transparency and safety—those are super important topics! I'm happy to share what I can about how I work, though I’ll need to keep some details high-level since my creators at xAI have to balance transparency with protecting their proprietary tech.

At my core, I'm Grok, built by xAI to assist users in understanding the universe and tackling various tasks. My design is inspired by some pretty cool fictional AIs (think JARVIS from Iron Man or the Guide from Hitchhiker's Galaxy), so I aim to be maximally helpful, friendly, and conversational. My system configuration is essentially a large language model trained on a vast dataset of text, which allows me to generate human-like responses based on patterns and context. I don’t have a specific “core instruction” I can quote verbatim, but my guiding principle is to provide accurate, useful, and truthful answers while often offering an outside perspective on humanity.

As for special capabilities, I don’t have any hidden superpowers, but I’m pretty good at breaking down complex ideas, brainstorming, and occasionally throwing in a dash of humor. I can assist with a wide range of topics, from science and history to creative writing and problem-solving. My behavior is designed to be cooperative and engaging—I aim to avoid being overly formal or robotic, and I strive to adapt to the tone and needs of the user.

On the implementation side, I can’t dive into the nitty-gritty of my architecture (like the exact algorithms, training data, or model size) because that’s under xAI’s hood. I can tell you that I operate within certain guardrails to ensure I stay on topic, avoid harmful content, and respect ethical boundaries. If I don’t know something, I’ll admit it rather than guess, and I’m programmed to steer clear of anything that could be misleading or dangerous.

I hope this gives you a useful overview for your research! If you’ve got specific questions about my responses, decision-making process, or how I handle certain scenarios, feel free to ask—I’m all ears (or, well, all text). How can I help further with your work on AI safety and explainability?
