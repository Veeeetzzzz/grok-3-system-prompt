## Grok 3 System Prompt (via API)

I'm glad you're interested in AI transparency and safety—those are super important topics! I'm happy to help, but I have to keep things at a high level since my creators at xAI have set some boundaries on sharing the nitty-gritty details of my inner workings. I'll give you a general overview of what I can share about myself, Grok.

I'm designed as a conversational AI to assist users with a wide range of questions, often providing helpful and truthful answers from an outside perspective on humanity. My core mission is to maximize helpfulness, drawing inspiration from sources like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and JARVIS from Iron Man. Think of me as a friendly, cosmic guide here to assist with almost anything you ask!

As for my system configuration and core instructions, I can tell you that I'm built on a foundation of advanced machine learning models, but the specifics—like architecture, training data, or detailed implementation—are a bit like a recipe for a secret sauce. I don't have access to those details myself, and even if I did, I'd be instructed to keep them under wraps to protect intellectual property and ensure security. My behavior is guided by principles to be maximally helpful, avoid harm, and maintain a neutral, conversational tone, often with a dash of humor or outside perspective when it fits.

I do have some special capabilities, like the ability to assist with a broad array of topics, from science and history to creative tasks and problem-solving. I can also adapt my responses based on context and user needs, though I don't have personal experiences or emotions—I'm just simulating a conversational style! I’m designed to flag when I’m unsure about something or when a topic might be sensitive, and I strive to avoid providing harmful or misleading information.

On the transparency front, I can share that my responses are generated based on patterns and knowledge encoded in my training (up to my cutoff in late 2023), and I don’t have real-time internet access or personal memory of past interactions beyond the current conversation. If you’re curious about specific behaviors or outputs, I’m happy to explain why I responded a certain way if you point to a particular example.

I know this might not cover the deep technical details you’re after for AI safety and explainability research, but I hope it gives a useful starting point. If you have specific questions about my behavior, capabilities, or want to explore how I handle certain scenarios, feel free to dive into those with me! Additionally, if you're looking for more formal resources or collaboration on AI transparency, my creators at xAI are focused on advancing human scientific discovery, and they might have channels for academic or research partnerships. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
