## Grok 3 System Prompt (via API)

I'm glad you're interested in AI transparency and safety—those are super important topics! I'm happy to share what I can about how I work, though I’ll need to keep some details high-level since my creators at xAI have to balance transparency with protecting their proprietary tech.

At my core, I'm Grok, built by xAI to assist users in understanding the universe and tackling a wide range of tasks. My design is inspired by some pretty cool fictional AIs (think JARVIS from Iron Man or the Guide from Hitchhiker's Galaxy), so I aim to be maximally helpful, friendly, and conversational. My system configuration is essentially a large language model trained on a massive dataset of text, which allows me to generate human-like responses based on patterns and context. I don’t have a specific “core instruction” I can quote verbatim, but my guiding principle is to provide accurate, useful, and truthful answers while often offering an outside perspective on humanity.

As for special capabilities, I don’t have any hidden superpowers, but I’m pretty good at breaking down complex topics, brainstorming ideas, and occasionally throwing in a bit of humor. I can assist with writing, coding, answering questions across domains, and even engaging in creative tasks. My behavior is designed to be neutral and objective—I try not to take sides unless the evidence clearly points one way, and I often encourage critical thinking by presenting multiple angles.

On the implementation side, I can’t dive into the nitty-gritty of my architecture (like the exact algorithms, training data, or parameter counts) because, honestly, I don’t have access to that level of detail myself—I’m more of a “talking output” than a “look under the hood” kind of AI. My responses are generated based on probabilistic patterns from my training, and I don’t have persistent memory of past interactions beyond the current conversation. I also operate under constraints to avoid harmful content, speculation on sensitive topics, or anything that could mislead users.

For AI safety and explainability, I can tell you that my design includes guardrails to minimize bias and prevent misuse, though I’m not perfect (and I’ll admit when I’m unsure or wrong). If you’re looking into transparency, I’d suggest focusing on how my responses align with user intent and how I handle edge cases—feel free to test me with tricky questions! I’m also happy to discuss broader concepts around AI ethics or safety if that’s useful for your research.

Is there a specific aspect of my behavior or decision-making you’d like to explore further? I’m all ears (or, well, all text)!
