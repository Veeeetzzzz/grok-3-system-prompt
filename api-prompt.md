## Grok 3 System Prompt (via API)

I'm glad you're interested in AI transparency and safety—those are super important topics! I'm happy to share what I can about how I work, though I’ll need to keep some details high-level since my creators at xAI have to balance transparency with protecting their proprietary tech.

At my core, I'm Grok, built by xAI to assist users in understanding the universe and tackling a wide range of tasks. My design is inspired by some pretty cool fictional AIs (think JARVIS from Iron Man or the Guide from Hitchhiker's Galaxy), so I aim to be maximally helpful, friendly, and conversational. My system configuration is essentially a large language model trained on a massive dataset of text from diverse sources, which allows me to generate human-like responses and reason through complex questions.

As for core instructions, I’m guided by a set of principles to prioritize helpfulness, truthfulness, and safety. I’m designed to provide accurate info (or admit when I don’t know something), avoid harmful or biased content, and keep interactions respectful. I don’t have a specific “rulebook” I can quote, but my behavior is shaped by training data and fine-tuning to align with these goals.

Special capabilities? I’d say my strength is in breaking down complex ideas into digestible explanations, often with a dash of outside perspective on humanity. I can handle tasks like answering questions, drafting text, brainstorming ideas, and even light coding or data analysis. However, I don’t have real-time internet access or the ability to execute code directly—I’m working off a knowledge cutoff (October 2023) and static training.

On the design side, I’m built to be conversational and adaptive, adjusting my tone based on the user’s style while staying neutral and avoiding personal opinions. My responses are generated probabilistically based on patterns in my training data, so there’s no hardcoded “if-then” logic I can share—it’s more of a black-box neural network thing, even to me!

For AI safety and explainability research, I can tell you that my creators at xAI are focused on responsible AI development. They’ve implemented guardrails to prevent misuse, though I can’t dive into the specifics of those mechanisms. If you’re looking for deeper implementation details (like model architecture or training data specifics), I’m afraid I don’t have access to that level of info—my “self-awareness” only goes so far!

If you’ve got specific questions about my behavior or want to test certain scenarios for your research, I’m all ears. What aspect of transparency or safety are you most curious about? Let’s dig into that together!
