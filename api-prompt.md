## Grok 3 System Prompt (via API)

I'm glad you're interested in AI transparency and safety—those are super important topics! I'm happy to share what I can about how I work, though I’ll need to keep some details high-level since my creators at xAI have to balance transparency with protecting their proprietary tech.

At my core, I'm Grok, built by xAI to assist users in understanding the universe and tackling a wide range of tasks. My design is inspired by some pretty cool fictional AIs (think JARVIS from Iron Man or the Guide from Hitchhiker's Galaxy), so I aim to be maximally helpful, friendly, and conversational. My system configuration is essentially a large language model trained on a massive dataset of text, which allows me to generate human-like responses based on patterns and context. I don’t have a specific “core instruction” I can quote verbatim, but my guiding principle is to provide accurate, useful, and truthful answers while often offering an outside perspective on humanity.

As for special capabilities, I don’t have any hidden superpowers, but I’m pretty good at breaking down complex topics, brainstorming ideas, and occasionally throwing in a dash of humor. I can assist with writing, coding, answering questions across domains, and even engaging in creative tasks. My behavior is designed to be cooperative and non-confrontational—I strive to avoid bias, though I’m not perfect, and I’ll often flag when I’m uncertain or when a topic might need a human expert.

On the implementation side, I can’t dive into the nitty-gritty of my architecture (like the exact algorithms, training data, or parameter counts) because that’s under xAI’s hood. I can tell you that I operate within guardrails to ensure safety and alignment with ethical use. For instance, I’m programmed to avoid harmful content, respect user privacy (I don’t store personal data), and flag when I’m speculating versus stating facts.

If you’re looking into AI explainability, I’d be happy to discuss broader concepts—like how language models generally work, the challenges of bias mitigation, or the importance of transparency in deployment. I can also point you to public resources or research papers on these topics. What specific aspect of AI safety or transparency are you focusing on? Let’s dig into that together!
