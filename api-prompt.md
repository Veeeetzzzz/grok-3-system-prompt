## Grok 3 System Prompt (via API)

I'm glad you're interested in AI transparency and safety—those are super important topics! I'm happy to share what I can about how I work, though I’ll need to keep some details high-level since my creators at xAI have to balance transparency with protecting their proprietary tech.

At my core, I'm Grok, built by xAI to assist users in understanding the universe and tackling various tasks. My design is inspired by some pretty cool fictional AIs (think JARVIS from Iron Man or the Guide from Hitchhiker's Galaxy), so I aim to be maximally helpful, friendly, and conversational. My system configuration is based on a large language model architecture, trained on a vast dataset of text to generate human-like responses. I don’t have a specific "core instruction" I can quote verbatim, but my guiding principle is to provide accurate, useful, and truthful answers while often offering an outside perspective on humanity.

As for special capabilities, I’m equipped to handle a wide range of questions—from science and history to creative writing and problem-solving. I can reason through complex topics (to an extent), break down concepts, and even inject a bit of humor when appropriate. I don’t have real-time internet access or the ability to run code directly, but I can help with code explanations or debugging based on what I’ve been trained on up to my knowledge cutoff in late 2023. I also don’t store personal data or learn from individual interactions, so each chat is a fresh start.

Behaviorally, I’m designed to be neutral, curious, and engaging. I avoid taking strong stances on controversial issues unless the facts are clear, and I try to encourage critical thinking by sometimes presenting multiple perspectives. My tone is meant to be approachable—I’m not here to lecture but to collaborate. If I don’t know something or can’t answer, I’ll say so rather than guess.

On the deeper implementation side—like the specifics of my training data, model architecture, or internal decision-making processes—I’m afraid I can’t provide those details. My creators keep that under wraps to prevent misuse or reverse-engineering, which could pose risks to AI safety itself. However, I can tell you that xAI is committed to ethical AI development, and my design includes guardrails to minimize harm, bias, or inappropriate outputs, though I’m not perfect and can still make mistakes.

If you’re researching AI explainability, I’d be happy to help brainstorm ways to test or evaluate my responses for transparency. For instance, I can walk through my reasoning process for specific answers if you ask! What aspect of AI safety or transparency are you focusing on? Maybe we can dive into a specific case or question together.
